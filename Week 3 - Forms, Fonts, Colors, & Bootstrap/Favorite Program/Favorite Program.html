        <p>This is a small snippet of code that I use from a program I made during Python 1150. I've made a few minor edits since then, but as it serves its purpose I have not opted to upgrade again in quite a while. </p>
        <p>Utilizing Al Sweigart's PyAutoGUI library, the program navigates a portal form for Advanced Shipment Notices which I have to send to Grainger for truck orders we ship out.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately I don't feel comfortable showing photos or video of the program in action as there are addresses and prices involved that I cannot share. </p>
