Watch the videos, build the app. Goal for this week is to get through at least videos 1-9 and hopefully 10-12 as well. If you finish them all, that's cool too! 

Please ask for help if you get stuck or have questions.

**Add comments to your code as you build the app - add notes to help you remember what each part does.  You should not comment every line. Focus on new concepts and on the more complex parts of the application.** 

To submit: a GitHub link with your current code. You may not be finished - that's ok, we'll work on this over two weeks.  Once you've finished the videos, there's a lab for next week with an extra task in so leave time for that.
