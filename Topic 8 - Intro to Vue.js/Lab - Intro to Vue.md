**For this lab, and every lab, add comments to your code to explain the new concepts, complex code, and anything that's not obvious from just reading the code.** 

**1. Code from slides/videos, 10 points:**

Make sure all of the apps from the slides/videos work:

-   The Hello Vue app that displays a message, adds exclamation points, and resets the message, and uses a computed property
-   The enter-your-name form, the one with the v-if directive that only displays a message if a name is entered, and displays a 'waiting for input' message if there is no name. The clear button should only be displayed if a name is entered, will clear the name. 
-   The shopping cart with the computed property for total
-   Task list with v-for, tasks added to list, input form cleared after new task added, all tasks displayed on page

**2. Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.  5 points**

What does this Vue warning message mean? Can you safely ignore it? What causes it, and how do you fix it?  Write an answer _**in your own words**_.

**3. Using Vue developer tools, 5 points**

Make sure you've installed Vue dev tools.

Link to install Vue dev tools extension for Chrome [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/ljjemllljcmogpfapbkkighbhhppjdbg) 

On Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) then click on Details for Vue dev tools, and look for the **Allow access to file URLs toggle**, turn this on. 

Restart your browser, and ensure that the Vue dev tools are working.

Take a screenshot of the shopping cart app showing the dev tools running, and **showing the data** stored in the shopping cart app. 

For example, your screenshot will look like the example below, but you should take a screenshot of your shopping cart app.

-   Taking a screenshot on Windows:  Windows Key + Shift + S. Click on the notification to save the screenshot.
-   Taking a Screenshot on Mac: Shift + Command + 4.  Screenshot will be saved on your desktop.

Add the code for all of your apps, a **TEXT** file with your answer to Q2, and the Vue dev tools screenshot, to a git repository and push to GitHub.
