A method of poor user experience that is common among many news sites is the use of paywalls. It drives down the number of viewers and sacrifices user experience. Though it makes for poor UX, the companies that do it with print media also available generally make more ad dollars via the printed ads. That's a sad state for users.

Good user experience sites generally offer a simplistic or easy to navigate site with visually stunning presentation. If it's not too meta, I'd like to put up the site Laws of UX (https://lawsofux.com/) as a great example of UX design. It's a perfectly simple design that is easily navigable in a way that would seem to be just as easy to a toddler or anyone with only the most basic of English language understanding.
